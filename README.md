# User Story - HR Dashboard
As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis

## Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

### Overview
The Overview section should provide a snapshot of the overall HR metrics, including:

Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)
Show the distribution of employees by city and state.
- Demographics
The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:

Present the gender ratio in the company.
Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
Show the total number of employees within each age group.
Show the total number of employees within each education level.
Present the correlation between employeesâ€™s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.
- Income
The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:

Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
Present how the age correlate with the salary for employees in each department.
